/* NOTES:
 1. I'm not sure why the Class creation is making my program not run, that's why I converted it to text.
 2. In Question n.3, I wasn't able to make it work if the var line has nothing in it (say "the line is empty")  * cries in spanish *
 3. I initially copied this to a playground to make sure evrything worked and then copied it here. It ran well on a playgound :/
 4. I'll also upload the playgournd (which was made a bit differently) just in case.
 5. Other than that, I had fun making this.
