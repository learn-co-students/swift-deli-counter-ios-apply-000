    //Additional ideas for functionality... Remove walkouts from the middle of the line? An iterating loop alerting each waiting person what their new position in line is when the line changes? Also, what if Space Meg Ryan or Space Billy Crystal walk into the Space Deli? We need to account for this important contigency...
